## Overview

As part of the API migration, API calls previously made to the inventory have now been replaced with the Definitions API. With this transition, Asset Models and Asset Properties now align with the latest data structure, making their schema more streamlined, clean, and easier to understand. Consequently, the Sample Asset Model has also undergone structural changes to ensure compatibility and support for the newly defined data structure within the Definitions API.
