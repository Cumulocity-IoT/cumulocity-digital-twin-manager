## Overview

The `Digital Twin Manager` enables you to create and manage assets around your physical connected devices in Cumulocity IoT. Assets can be used to structure and describe devices in logical hierarchies as encountered in the real world environment. In addition, assets in Cumulocity IoT can be extended and enriched with addtional information using the `Properties Library`.

The home screen of the DTM application gives an overview of the application. You can see the number of asset models, asset properties and assets available at a glance. You can add asset properties, asset models and assets using the quick links.

After following these instructions, the application will be deployed on the tenant and is ready for use. In the application switcher on the top right you can now select the `Digital Twin Manager` application.

If you want to use `Import assets` functionality, then the microservice needs to be installed.

### For installation of microservice:

1. Download dtm-ms-10xx.x.x.zip from the [release section](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-digital-twin-manager/releases)
2. Open the `Administration` application in your Cumulocity tenant
3. Navigate to `Ecosystem` --> `Microservice`
4. Click on `Add microservice`
5. Select Upload microservice in the modal dialog
6. Select the zip archive of microservice, which you downloaded from the release section, to upload it to the tenant
7. When prompted Subscribe to microservice select Subscribe

After following these instructions, the microservice will be deployed on the tenant. Once the microservice is deployed you can use `Import Assets` feature.

`Note: If the microservice is deployed but not subscribed, then the Import Assets button will not visible in assets page.`

### Configure a role to use the bulk import feature

## Features

### Overview of features

The `Digital Twin Manager` consists of the following features, which support you to create your assets and asset hierarchies:

* `Property library` - Create your own custom properties (simple or complex) to define how data should be stored on an asset
* `Asset types` - Define asset types to describe the blueprint of your assets
* `Localization` - Dynamically translate asset type and custom property descriptions to multiple languages
* `Asset tree` - View and navigate to the subassets page of the asset hierarchy.
* `Bulk import` - To import the entire asset hierarchy with all the assets at once.

### Property Library

The Property Library can be used to create your own custom properties to define how data should be stored on an asset. These custom properties can be either complex (nested object) or simple (key-value pair). Furthermore, you can choose a specific data type for each property you define. As of now, the Property Library supports following data types: Text, Number, Date Picker, Enumeration, Boolean.

<div align="center"><i>Property Library screen displaying the list of properties and an option to add or edit the property.</i></div>

### Asset Types

Asset Types serve as a blueprint for your assets and define how they are structured. An Asset Type defines what custom properties an asset should have. Additionally, you can specify relationships between multiple Asset Types, which will be respected when you create your actual asset hierarchies. Once the Asset Type is created, it can be used to create various assets.

<div align="center"><i>Edit Asset Type screen displaying the details of the selected asset type.</i></div>

### Localization

You can use the Localization component to define translations for your asset types and custom properties. These translations can be provided for all supported languages in Cumulocity IoT. This component requires to have the `feature-branding` feature subscribed for your Cumulocity tenant.

<div align="center"><i>Localization screen displaying the list of translated terms for your asset types and custom properties.</i></div>

### Asset tree

The Asset tree tab is used to view the child assets hierarchy and can also navigate to the subassets page. You can add child assets using **Add asset** button and can also import the child assets using **Import assets** button.

<div align="center"><i>Asset tree tab displaying the child asset hierarchy of the selected asset.</i></div>

### Bulk import
To import all the assets of a particular asset hierarchy at once, use the bulk import feature. Microservice is being used to download the template and import the assets. To use the Bulk import feature, user must be part of a role that has `Admin` permission level for **Digital twin** type.
