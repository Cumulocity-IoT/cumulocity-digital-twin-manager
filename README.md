# Cumulocity Digital Twin Manager

## Overview

The `Digital Twin Manager` enables you to create and manage assets around your physical connected devices in Cumulocity IoT. Assets can be used to structure and describe devices in logical hierarchies as encountered in the real world environment. In addition, assets in Cumulocity IoT can be extended and enriched with addtional information using the `Properties Library`.

## Components

### Overview

The `Digital Twin Manager` consists of several components, which support you to create your assets and asset hierarchies:

* `Property library` - Create your own custom properties (simple or complex) to define how data should be stored on an asset
* `Asset types` - Define asset types to describe the blueprint of your assets
* `Localization` - Dynamically translate asset type and custom property descriptions to multiple languages
* `Assets navigator` - Manage your asset hierarchies
* `Bulk import` - To import the entire asset hierarchy with all the assets at once.

### Property Library

The Property Library can be used to create your own custom properties to define how data should be stored on an asset. These custom properties can be either complex (nested object) or simple (key-value pair). Furthermore, you can choose a specific data type for each property you define. As of now, the Property Library supports following data types: Text, Number, Date Picker, Enumeration, Boolean.

### Asset Types

Asset Types serve as a blueprint for your assets and define how they are structured. An Asset Type defines what custom properties an asset should have. Additionally, you can specify relationships between multiple Asset Types, which will be respected when you create your actual asset hierarchies. Once the Asset Type is created, it can be used to create various assets.

### Localization

You can use the Localization component to define translations for your asset types and custom properties. These translations can be provided for all supported languages in Cumulocity IoT. This component requires to have the `feature-branding` feature subscribed for your Cumulocity tenant.

### Assets Navigator

The Assets Navigator is the starting point to create your asset hierarchies based on the asset types and custom properties, you have defined previously. Once you have created your asset hierarchies you can use the Assets Navigator to view and manage them.

### Bulk import
To import all the assets of a particular asset hierarchy at once, use the bulk import feature. Microservice is being used to download the template and import the assets. 
To use the Bulk Import feature, you must provide the permission for **Digital Twin** role. Once the permissions are assigned, the bulk import feature can be used.

Note: If the permissions are not assigned, then the CSV template will not be downloaded correctly.

### Download a CSV template for bulk import

1. On click of Import assets button in the assets page, a dialog box appears with an option to **Choose asset type**.  
	* If no asset types are created yet, only the asset type "Group" is listed in the dropdown. 
	* If you have added the asset types, all the root asset types are listed in the dropdown. 
2. Select the asset type for which you want to create the asset hierarchy. 
3. On selection, two additional options appear.
	* **Drop file here** - upload the CSV template as a file, for importing assets in bulk.
	* **Download Template** - download the CSV template for the selected asset type.
4. Click **Download Template** to download the CSV template.

The CSV template has the following fields:

1.	AssetType / DeviceType : Enter the key of the asset type
2.	AssetName : Provide the name of the asset you want to create
3.	Path : Remains blank when you create a root asset. For a child asset, provide a path up to the root asset
4.	Device ID / External ID : If the asset being created has a device associated with it, then provide the Device ID of the device here
5.	Description : briefly describes the asset being created
6.	Custom properties for the asset type : 6th column onwards (in the CSV template), all the custom properties for the root asset types and all its subsequent child asset types are listed

Note: Modify the excel settings to provide the date in a YYYY-MM-DD format. This prevents an auto-correct of the date on input.

To provide a file input as a custom property value, the file must first be uploaded to a Cumulocity IoT tenant using the API.

Refer to the Binaries API https://cumulocity.com/api/10.13.0/#operation/postBinariesCollectionResource in the openapi for details on how to upload a file.

The binary ID in the API response must be provided as input for the custom property field with type "file" in the CSV template.

If the type is "Boolean", the input field must be either "true" or "false".
If the type is "enumeration", then the input field must be in the list of values specified during creation of the custom property.
If the type is "text" or "number" and custom criteria were provided during custom property creation, then the input value in CSV template must fulfill all the custom property criteria.

### To upload a CSV template

1. Upload the previously filled and saved CSV template in the **Drop file here** section.

2. If all the inputs are provided correctly, the bulk import is successful, resulting in a success notification. The asset hierarchy and its assets are created successfully.

3. View the newly created assets in the **Assets** page.

If the inputs are not provided in the correct format, the bulk import fails with validation errors, resulting in a **Failed asset imports** notification, showing the issue types, for example, an invalid template or an incorrect asset hierarchy.
No assets are created.

If the bulk import fails, review the reported issues and try again.

### Partial import

If the asset hierarchy already exists, and you want to import more assets, it can be achieved by a partial import.

To import the child asset hierarchy or the child assets:

1. Fill in the details for the child asset hierarchy in the CSV template.

	Note: From any hierarchy level, the template will be downloaded only for its child hierarchy.
	Assets must only be imported for the child hierarchy.

2. Enter the details for the child assets in the CSV template.

3. Upload the CSV template in the **Drop file here** section in the **Import assets** dialog.

If all details are mentioned correctly in the CSV template, the child asset hierarchy is created successfully.

An unsuccessful partial import will result in a **Failed asset imports** notification, showing the validation issues.
Review the reported issues and try again.

## Installation

The `Digital Twin Manager` is shipped as a standalone application for now. This means it will be installed as a separate application, which provides all the features of the `Digital Twin Manager` as described in the component section. The standalone application is available in the [release section](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-digital-twin-manager/releases) and can be downloaded.

For installation:

1. Open the `Administration` application in your Cumulocity tenant
2. Navigate to `Applications` --> `Own applications`
3. Click on `Add application`
4. Select `Upload web application` in the modal dialog
5. Select the zip archive, which you downloaded from the release section, to upload it to the tenant

After following these instructions, the application will be deployed on the tenant and is ready for use. In the application switcher on the top right you can now select the `Digital Twin Manager` application.
